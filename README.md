# Hello
A little about me...

I'm Mykie.
I live in the beautiful town of Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona.
I own a computer company called Mykie's Macs here in town.
I am also just recently the Operating and Managing Partner of ABC Complete Landscaping LLC.
I try to stay busy and help others with as many computer problems as I can.
Just recently got into coding.
It is definitely an adventure... :/

I made this GitHub to pretty much just keep an offsite backup of projects I'm working on.
Some are created for my companies, and some are created for fun & learning or a tool I may need.
If it doesn't seem 'business related' I'll probably approve the pull if you want it...
Business apps? Probably not... Privacy issues and proprietary information... Hope you understand!

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to interact with you out in the coding world!  :)

<3 Mykie
